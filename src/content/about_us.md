Have you ever wondered what it would be like to create your own website, build artificial intelligence models, or bring your innovative ideas to life through programming? Or do you want to meet new people learning to code to share exciting ideas and projects? Look no further! We are thrilled to present crossdot, an exciting new coding initiative designed specifically for those who are new to programming.

At crossdot, we understand that starting your coding journey can feel intimidating. That's why we've created a supportive and inclusive environment where beginners can learn at their own pace, ask questions without hesitation, and embark on an exciting adventure into the world of programming. Together, we'll demystify programming concepts, unravel the secrets of writing code, and celebrate every small victory along the way. No question is too basic, and no challenge is insurmountable when you have a supportive network by your side.

Our club is built on the foundation of inclusivity, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their background or experience, feels welcome and valued. No matter your age, gender, or background, crossdot is here to empower you to become a confident programmer.

## How does Crossdot work?

Crossdot is led by our members - anyone is free to join the team and contribute in leading a session of their own design. Events are based around activities written up in *articles* - easy to follow tutorials with clear, tangible goals to learn a certain skill. In meetups, anyone is welcome to come and complete the activity, ask for help, or move on to more advanced work.

The best part? Crossdot is entirely free! We believe that cost should never be a barrier to exploring the world of coding. Thanks to our team members, we are able to provide all our resources and events at no cost. Our mission is to make programming accessible to everyone and empower beginners to discover their passion for coding.

## What topics do we cover?

We are always open to suggestions, but understand that even choosing where to get started is a very intimidating task! We therefore provide two introductory routes into programming through *Python* and *Javascript*. Not only are these languages excellent for beginner programmers, but make up the top two programming languages in industry, particularly in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Web Development respectively!

Projects in Python include:

*  

Projects for Javascript include:
